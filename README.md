  Spring months-> 3, 4, 5 
  Summer months->6, 7, 8 
  Autumn months->9, 10, 11 
  Winter months->12, 1, 2 

5) Create an array of three employee names. Create another array that associates employee names with their salary values. Print both arrays using foreach loop.

6) Write a program that will accept an array of integers as input, and output an array where for each item in the source array, the new array will perform the following operations: 
  For even numbers divide by 2
  For odd numbers multiply by 3

7) Write PHP code to declare an associative array of six elements that has supermarket item names associated with their price. Print the array using foreach loop followed by the total cost of items.

  b. Display the size of an array
  c. Delete an element from an array from the given index.
  d. Reverse the order of each elementâ€™s key-value pair 
  e. Traverse the elements in an array in random order 

5) Perform the following operations on associative arrays:
  a. Sort the array by values (changing the keys) in ascending, descending order.
  b. Also sort the array by values without changing the keys.
  c. Filter the odd elements from an array.
  d. Sort the different arrays at a glance using single function.
  e. Merge the given arrays.
